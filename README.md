## ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Alex!

### ðŸ‘€ I'm currently looking for full time positions to start in January 2025!

I'm an undergrad CS student at the University of Texas at Dallas, graduating December 2024.

I love creating software tools to make repetitive tasks easier, and am interested in many things:

- Compilers
- Programming language design
- Formal verification
- Game development and rendering
