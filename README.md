### ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Alex!

I'm an undergrad CS student at the University of Texas at Dallas. Interested in game development and solving problems. Check out games I've worked on [here](https://alex5nader.itch.io/)!

Currently, I'm working on a few Minecraft mods: [Framed](https://github.com/alex5nader/Framed) and [Pick Up](https://github.com/alex5nader/Pick-Up). Any contributions are welcome!
